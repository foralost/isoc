Rock Ridge / System Use Sharing Protocol
.description
The anxiously awaited new, 1.12 versions of the System Use Sharing Protocol
and the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol are now available for review and
comment.  The documents are available through anonymous ftp at ftp.ossi.com
in /pub.

The documents are available in both MS Word 6 format (*.doc) and Postscript
format (*.ps).  Otherwise, the file names should be self-explanatory.  The
files are called: rrip112.doc, rrip112.ps, susp112.doc, and susp112.ps.

If you have comments or constructive criticism of these new versions of the
specifications, please feel free to respond to cdfdf@ymi.com.  We are trying
to get these documents to ballot as an IEEE standard soon, so we would
appreciate prompt response.  We hope to review all the responses at the next
working group meeting on August 26, 1994, so any responses we gather by end
of business of August 24 will be considered at that meeting.
