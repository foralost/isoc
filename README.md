# ISO FS to FAT32 MBR converter with your own bootloader

My attempt to create a program which will allow to read an .ISO file, and create an MBR partition table with 1 FAT32 partition containing whole device. Also, there will be a support of loading your own bootloader onto the MBR partition table, and given partition.
